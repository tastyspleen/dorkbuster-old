Welcome.  This is a prerelease of dorkbuster.

There isn't much documentation yet, sorry.

See the files, users-example.cfg and server-example.cfg for
information on two files you will need to rename and edit
to get dorkbuster running.

You'll also need ruby to run dorkbuster.  Check the version
of ruby installed in your system with: ruby --version

You'll want ruby version 1.8.1 or greater.


Regards,

Bill
