#
#-add:  [NOT ADDED] Background UDP quake command I/O, so no lag when server down?
#       (Worked out approach, but decided against due to added complexity
#       in program logic.)
#
#-add:  [NOT ADDED] Muting & banning based on IP, (re-)enforced on connect
#       pretz: I remember a feature I wish I had...
#       quadz: yeas?
#       pretz: ice_god's a pain sometimes, so I mute him hoping he'll chill out.
#       pretz: But he just reconnects to dodge the mute penalty time.
#       pretz: A timed mute on connect would do it.
#       pretz: And to be really effective, console should say something about muting
#       the person when the connection is made and how long they have left on the mute.
#       (Pretz is handling this via fluff...)
#
# In V0.2.2:
#+new: (pretz) Encased name in "'s for status...
#
# In V0.2.1:
#+add:  VT100 color coding of chat messages? (http://www.termsys.demon.co.uk/vtansi.htm)
#       (quick hack)
#
#+bug:  Fixed bug introduced in incomplete fix related to
#       protection of peeraddr stuff (in failed password attempt.)
#
# In V0.2:
#+bug: doesn't write to client somehow unless client sends chars??
#      (perhaps just on backspacing, when hitting zero chars in
#       buffer... then flush write)
#
#+fix: should lock gamestate.dat during reads/writes?  (argh... no...
#      hmm, would be nice if multiple Dork Buster processes to different
#      servers could use same names-to-ips database... but different
#      client/server-state data...)
#      For now: uses server_nickname to create uniquely named database files
#
#+fix: peeraddr can throw too... guard those
#
#+fix: don't echo weird terminal chars!!
#
#+fix: status should do a "real" status with aka's not the rcon status default
#
#+new: db search: IP for names, name for IPs...
#     02:49:00 pretz: Two types: current client (or IP) to name...
#     02:49:10 pretz: and name to IP's used in the passed.
#     02:49:23 quadz: yeah, it's really easy to add this stuff... now that the basic deal is functional
#     02:49:44 pretz: So I could see if someone's been a fake frosty
#
#+new: rcon_clients and rcon_all_clients ;)
